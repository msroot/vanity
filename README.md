# Vanity 2 (Alpha)

**Vanity is a tool that generates documentation from PHP source code by using _reflection_.**

Vanity was created as a much-improved replacement for [NaturalDocs](http://naturaldocs.org). Now, however, I'm rewriting it to use PHPDoc syntax instead.

## Why?

* The project was started because it appears that work on NaturalDocs 2.0 has stalled, and even then, PHP is not treated as a first-class citizen.
* I also wanted something that allowed me to write my own HTML templates. None of the current solutions make that easy (e.g. PHPDocumentor, NaturalDocs, Doxygen).
* I'm inspired by how good the third-party Ruby on Rails and jQuery documentation systems are. I wanted to build something that had my favorite features (e.g. search, browse, keyboard navigation, inline examples, comments).
